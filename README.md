# Movie_recomdML

This project is aimed at recommending movies based on user input. It utilizes machine learning techniques implemented with various libraries.

## Overview

The project utilizes the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Difflib
- Scikit-learn
- Cosine Similarity

## Steps Involved

1. Feature Extraction:
   - Extracted important features from the dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Preprocessed the dataset and combined all the important features.

3. Feature Vectorization:
   - Used TfidfVectorizer to transform the data into feature vectors.

4. Cosine Similarity Calculation:
   - Calculated cosine similarity on the feature vectors.

5. User Input Processing:
   - Took input from the user and checked for the most closely matched movie from our dataset using the Difflib library.

6. Finding Index:
   - Obtained the index of the entered movie in our dataset.

7. Similarity Score Calculation:
   - Checked the similarity score and sorted it in decreasing order to print the most similar to least similar movies.

8. Recommendation Printingd:
   - Printed up to 15 recommendations.
